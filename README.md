# V2XSynth

**V2XSynth** is an LLM+RAG framework that compiles natural-language intents into **communication-aware** V2X scenarios in **CARLA**, assembling Scenic behavior specs, spatial/map context, and empirical SPaT/MAP/BSM profiles into executable simulations.

## Highlights
- **LLM Agent Analysis.** The Interpreter turns prompts into a structured spec \(S=(V,R,P,E,M)\); the Agent validates with schema+priors, disambiguates intent, and guards against drift before retrieval.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation.** Behavior/map/V2X stores are queried with constraint checks, then bound into deterministic **Scenic + Python** for CARLA with spatial, behavioral, and communication consistency.
- **Automated V2X Scenario Synthesis.** Infrastructure-aware placement (signal richness + centrality), realistic latency/jitter/loss/decoding, and joint mobilityâ€“messaging telemetry that drives closed-loop fault exploration.
